              Atlanta Beginnings: It was 1886, and in New York Harbour, workers were constructing the Statue of Liberty. Eight hundred miles away, another great American symbol was about to be unveiled.
              Like many people who change history, John Pemberton, an Atlanta pharmacist, was inspired by simple curiosity. One afternoon, he stirred up a fragrant, caramel-coloured liquid and, when it was done, he carried it a few doors down to Jacobs' Pharmacy. Here, the mixture was combined with carbonated water and sampled by customers who all agreed - this new drink was something special. So Jacobs' Pharmacy put it on sale for five cents (about 3p) a glass.

            <p class="card-text"> Dr Pepper's unique, sparkling blend of 23 fruit flavours has been around for well over a century and it's still the same, with that distinctive flavour you just can't quite put your tongue on.
              It was created by Texas pharmacist Charles Alderton in 1885. He gave a sample of the first ever batch to Wade Morrison, a local shop owner, and Mr Morrison instantly agreed to stock the drink. The distinctive, bold taste of Dr Pepper has been popular ever since.
